# commented-configparser

A custom ConfigParser class that preserves comments and option casing when writing loaded config out.

This library gives you a custom class of the standard library's `configparser.ConfigParger` which will preserve the comments of a loaded config file when writing that file back out.

---

## Install via pip

From pypi:

```bash
python -m pip install commented-configparser
```

From github:

```bash
python -m pip install commented-configparser@git+https://github.com/Preocts/commented-configparser@x.x.x
```

**Note:** Replace `x.x.x` with the desired tag or branch.

---

## Example use

```py
from commentedconfigparser import CommentedConfigParser

# Load the config like normal
config = CommentedConfigParser()
config.read("myconfig.ini")

# Use the config like normal
...

# Update the config like normal
...

# Save the config back to the file
with open("myconfig.ini", "w") as savefile:
    config.write(savefile)
```

## Results

We favor the line spacing choices of the `ConfigParser` class so the input format may not be preserved completely. However, the comments will be preserved.

### Before

```ini
# Welcome to our config
[DEFAULT]
# This value has some meaning to someone
foo=bar
# Make sure to add this when you need it
trace=false
logging=true
; This is a comment as well

    # so we need to track all of them

	; and many could be between things
[NEW SECTION]
# Another comment
multi-line=
	value01
	value02
	value03
closing=0
# Trailing comment

```

### After

```ini
# Welcome to our config
[DEFAULT]
# This value has some meaning to someone
foo = bar
# Make sure to add this when you need it
trace = false
logging = true
; This is a comment as well
# so we need to track all of them
; and many could be between things

[NEW SECTION]
# Another comment
multi-line =
	value01
	value02
	value03
closing = 0
# Trailing comment

```
